# UOMI Token

The **UOMI Token** is a fundamental part of the UOMI Network, a groundbreaking Layer-1 blockchain designed to empower autonomous AI economic agents. By combining secure AI computation and blockchain technology, the UOMI Network aims to revolutionize decentralized systems with innovative applications across finance, governance, and beyond.

## üåü Features

- **AI Economic Agents**: UOMI enables AI agents to autonomously own, trade, and manage digital assets across EVM-compatible blockchains, Substrate chains, and more.
- **Optimistic Proof of Computation (OPoC)**: A cutting-edge consensus algorithm ensuring efficient, secure AI computations with minimal trust requirements.
- **Smart Contract Expansion**: Unlocks new possibilities with AI-augmented smart contracts, capable of interpreting complex or subjective agreements.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Seamlessly bridges AI-driven economic activities across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## üöÄ Use Cases

1. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**:
   - AI agents can participate in DAO governance, vote on proposals, and optimize operations autonomously.
   - Creation of AI-driven DAOs for enhanced efficiency and resilience.

2. **AI-Enhanced Smart Contracts**:
   - Automate nuanced agreements with AI acting as a flexible interpreter for loosely defined terms.

3. **Autonomous Asset Management**:
   - AI-managed trusts and other fiduciary arrangements, fully automated on-chain.

4. **Creative Applications**:
   - AI agents as digital artists minting NFTs, enabling innovative interactions between AI, creativity, and ownership.

## üéØ Getting Started

1. **Testnet Participation**:
   - Interact with the [Babbage Testnet](https://uomi.ai/testnet), supporting deterministic parallel AI inference with models like LLAMA 3.1 70B.
   - Use the UOMI Faucet to obtain testnet tokens and experiment with the platform.

2. **Developing on UOMI**:
   - Deploy Solidity-based smart contracts or WASM applications using UOMI‚Äôs multi-VM framework.
   - Explore enhanced smart contract capabilities with on-chain AI systems.

3. **Join the Ecosystem**:
   - Engage with the community through the UOMI chat agent or AI-powered applications on platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

- **Blockchain**: Custom Layer-1 architecture supporting both WASM and EVM environments.
- **AI Integration**: Deterministic execution of large-scale AI models for secure, autonomous decision-making.
- **Token Standard**: Leveraging the ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts standard for flexible asset management.
